## How I Work

**Business-First Thinking:** Technology is a means to an end. Every solution I build is designed to drive measurable business outcomes, not just technical elegance.

**Pragmatic Innovation:** I embrace new technologies when they solve real problems, not for the sake of being cutting-edge. Boring technology that works is often the right choice.

**Knowledge Transfer:** My goal is to make myself unnecessary. I build solutions and train teams so organizations can sustain and evolve their technology independently.

**Continuous Learning:** The technology landscape changes constantly. I dedicate significant time to learning, experimenting, and staying ahead of industry trends.
