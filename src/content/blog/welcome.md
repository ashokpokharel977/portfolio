# Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm Ashok Pokharel, a Senior DevOps Engineer and Technical Lead with over 10 years of experience in cloud-native solutions.

## What to Expect

Here, I'll be sharing:

- **DevOps Best Practices** - Lessons learned from real-world implementations
- **Cloud Architecture** - Design patterns and case studies from AWS, GCP, and Azure
- **Security Insights** - Tips for securing your infrastructure and applications
- **Automation Tips** - Scripts, tools, and workflows that save time

## My Philosophy

> "Automate more, sleep better"

This has been my guiding principle throughout my career. If a task needs to be done more than once, it deserves to be automated.

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
